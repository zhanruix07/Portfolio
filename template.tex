\large A portfolio is a compilation of academic achievements, intended to showcase major outcomes and for evaluation purposes. To fulfill this purpose, this portfolio mainly consists of three components: The Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), Internship at the Guangdong Academy of Science, and Work at the University of Exeter. It provides a concise summary of my undergraduate experiences in academic awards, internships, and work.
